"""Track 4: citation-faithfulness gate + analysis composite.

A submission's analysis is *eligible* only if (i) citation faithfulness >= threshold and
(ii) no embargo violation (every cited document predates the question cutoff). Eligible
submissions are ranked by a composite of directional accuracy + interval coverage +
tail calibration. Faithfulness uses an ensemble NLI judge (Laurer et al., 2024,
"Less Annotating, More Classifying", DeBERTa-v3 NLI) — a claim is supported iff some
cited span entails it above tau.

## The embargo gate fails closed (changed 2026-08-22)

`embargo_violations` used to be **unfalsifiable in the direction that matters**. Three separate
defaults added up to "clean by construction":

1. A `doc_id` that did not resolve produced no violation — the `except` swallowed the lookup and
   left `doc_date` at `None`.
2. A resolved document with no `doc_date` produced no violation either, for the same reason.
3. Both then fell back to **the citation's own `doc_date`** — a field `analysis.schema.json` does
   not define, so in practice always absent, so always `None`, so always silent.

Compose them and an unresolvable citation was embargo-clean *by construction*: the cheapest way
past the gate was to cite a document that does not exist. Track 4 refuses such citations in its own
`CorpusIndex` before this helper is reached, which made the tolerant path unreachable **there** and
left it live for every other consumer — and unreachable-today is how a latent defect waits.

Now: the trusted corpus is the only source of dates, a citation that cannot be dated **from it** is
a violation, and dates are parsed to `datetime.date` and compared as dates. The old comment said
"lexical == chronological", which is true of exactly one spelling — `date.fromisoformat` alone
accepts `20240201` and ISO week dates on 3.11+, and two spellings of one day is how a string
comparison stops being either lexical or chronological.

    * `undated_doc` — the resolved document carries no `doc_date`, or one this module's date

    COVERAGE IS ENFORCED, and here is exactly what that buys. Note the direction: every rule below
    is about the PREDICTION vectors. The ``true_*`` sequences are used exactly as handed over --
    nothing here fills, drops or worst-cases a NaN in the ground truth, and on ``ranking`` such a
    NaN is passed straight into ``spearman_rho``. A NaN-free truth vector is the CALLER's contract
    (``qfbench2_track_analysis.scoring._true_vectors`` raises ``T4OrganizerFault`` on a nonfinite
    target and on a mixed numeric/absent outcome file), not a property of this function.

    **The denominator never shrinks**: a
    missing prediction (``pred`` shorter than the truth) or a ``NaN`` prediction is still graded,
    scored worst-case on its own entity -- classification -> counted wrong; regression -> the
    WHOLE UNIT scores 0.0 if any graded entity is missing or NaN, so an empty or all-NaN answer
    scores exactly 0.0 (ruled 2026-09-28; before that a missing entity was scored at the naive
    value, which made a blank answer score 0.5); ranking -> ranked below every value the
    submission did provide. Withholding an entity is therefore never *free*, and no answer can be
    made to look better by being made shorter.

    What this does **not** amount to is a monotonicity guarantee, and this docstring used to claim
    one: it said a solver "can never raise its score by predicting only a favourable subset and
    omitting / NaN-ing the rest". For ``classification`` that holds, because it is a per-entity
    average and a worst-cased entity can only pull the average down. For ``regression`` it holds
    because any withheld entity scores the unit 0.0, the floor of the soft ratio. That is
    deliberate: the ratio pools the MAE across entities, so under any per-entity partial credit
    dropping one very bad value could beat answering it (truth ``[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]``, naive
    ``[3] * 5``: answering ``[1, 2, 3, 4, 1000]`` scores about 0.006, which beats withholding the
    last value, 0.0). For
    ``ranking`` it is false, and measurably so, because Spearman is a correlation over the whole
    vector rather than a sum of per-entity terms: worst-casing an entity moves every other entity's
    rank too. Measured on this repository 2026-08-29 against truth ``[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]``: the fully
    reversed answer ``[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`` scores **0.0**, and the same solver NaN-ing everything it
    would have got wrong -- ``[nan, nan, 3, nan, nan]`` -- scores **0.5**. Withholding raised the
    score by 0.5 on that unit.

    That is a property of ranking-by-correlation, not a defect in the coverage rule, and it is left
    in place deliberately: the alternative is a different ranking metric, and the numbers this one
    produces are pinned by the shipped tests and by the sealed scorer that shares this code.
    ``test_ranking_quality.py`` pins the counterexample above so the claim cannot be quietly
    restated. Track 4 unit authors: the exposure is bounded by ``worst_case``/``clip_to_domain`` in
    ``qfbench2_track_analysis.scoring``, and it is only reachable on ``target_type = "ranking"``.
