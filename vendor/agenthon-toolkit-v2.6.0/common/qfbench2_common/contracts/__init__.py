"""`qfbench2_common.contracts` — the frozen C1-C8 interface, contract set 1.1.0.

## Executive summary (read this first)

This subpackage is the single implementation of the eight shared contracts frozen on 2026-08-21.
Runner, CodaBench, the website and all four tracks are **consumers** of these definitions; nobody
keeps a local copy (global rule 3).

| Contract | Module | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| C1 | `plan` | Evaluation plan: roster commitment, metric domain, failure policy |
| C2 | `run_record` | Trusted run record: what the organizer's infrastructure observed |
| C3 | `artifact_tree` | Sanitized participant artifact tree: roots, node policy, manifest |
| C4 | `result` | Scorer result and the fixed-denominator aggregate |
| C5 | `descriptor` | Canonical submission descriptor |
| C6 | `sealed` | Sealed pointer: public handle + signed resolver descriptor |
| C7 | `hardware` | Hardware/queue/runtime/egress, provenance-aware |
| C8 | `release` | Release evidence manifest |
| —  | `heartbeat` | Worker preflight report, bound to a C7 instance by digest |

Cross-cutting: `errors` (the strict accessor `req`), `digest` (RFC 8785 canonicalization),
`signing` (the Ed25519 envelope and the fail-closed trust store), `codes` (the closed C4 enum).

Four rules bind every one of them, and they are why this package exists:

1. **An absent field is an error, never a satisfied constraint.** Read contract fields with `req`.
2. **Digests are computed one way** — sha256 over RFC 8785 canonical JSON, NFC paths.
3. **Enums are closed.** No "unknown/other" bucket anywhere.
4. **Unknown means not rankable.** An empty trust store, an unmeasured C7 field and an absent
   attestation all degrade to "not rankable", never to "silently permitted".

Golden fixtures ship **inside the package** (`contracts/fixtures/`) so CodaBench and the website
consume the same bytes the tests verify, rather than each maintaining a hand-written example.

## Contract set 1.1.0

Per-contract versioning is what makes a bump cheap: only the documents that actually changed moved.

| Contract | Version | What changed |
|---|---|---|
| C1 `plan` | **1.2.0** | Sealed-phase handles must be opaque; a handle grammar and a derivation helper. 1.2.0 closes `scoring_params.target_type` and `scoring_params.composite_weights`; `contract_set` deliberately did not move with it (see `plan.py`) |
| C2 `run_record` | **1.1.0** | `observation_contradicted`; required `applied.gpu.selector` |
| C7 `hardware` | **1.1.0** | `worker_env` has a required role set, including `scratch_root` |
| C8 `release` | **1.1.0** | Required `phase_visibility`; ratified competition ids; sign-off roles |
| — `heartbeat` | 1.0.0 | New: promoted from the operator repo |
| C5 `descriptor` | **1.1.0** | `models` may be empty: a model-free submission declares `models: []` instead of inventing a row (every declared row still needs all five fields) |
| C3, C4, C6 | 1.0.0 | Unchanged |

`contracts/MIGRATIONS.md` is the participant-facing summary: it lists only the parts of the set
that constrain a submission (C5, C3, C4). 1.1.0 is the first published contract set, so there is
no earlier published version to migrate from; the organizer-side changes above are recorded in
each module's own `SCHEMA_VERSION` comment.
