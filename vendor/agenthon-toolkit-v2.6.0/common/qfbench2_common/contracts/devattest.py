"""C2 for the **Development phase**, produced by the Hub attesting its own observation.

## Why this module exists

The frozen topology puts a third program between ingestion and scoring: the Runner helper reads the
Hub's unsigned observation, checks it against host facts it gathered itself, signs it, and files C2
in `_control/run_records/`. `score.py` requires that file for every unit on the C1 roster and treats
its absence as an organizer fault.

**CodaBench has no third program slot.** A competition bundle names an ingestion program and a
scoring program, and the platform runs exactly those two. The Runner helper
(`runner.attest.produce_run_record`) is a library with no production caller
and no entry point, and it could not be given one from inside either stage: it builds C2 from
`HostFacts` — `docker inspect` of the unit container — and the ingestion program removes that
container before it returns. So on the Development phase the choice is between an evidence chain
nobody can produce and an honest, weaker one that says so.

This module is the honest weaker one. It is NOT a stand-in for the Runner and does not pretend to
be:

* **It is signed by a different key.** `DEV_SELFATTEST_KEY_ID`, not `DEV_KEY_ID`. A reader can tell
  a Hub self-attestation from a Runner attestation by looking at one field, and a trust store that
  does not carry the key rejects the record through the check that already exists.
* **It never declares a run rankable.** `rankability.state` is always `unrankable`; the only
  question is which controls it names. `_assert_never_rankable` runs on the finished document, so
  the guarantee is a property of the bytes rather than of the code path that produced them.
* **It refuses outside the Development profile.** A production trust store, a production execution
  profile, or any signing key that is not the published self-attestation key is a refusal, not a
  warning.

## What it actually checks, and why the verdict is honest

An attestation whose only source is the document it attests confirms nothing. So this does perform
one real, independent comparison: it re-reads the **published sanitized tree** from the scoring
namespace and re-verifies it against the persisted C3 descriptor, both ways —
`SanitizedTree.verify_digest()` re-derives the root digest from the entries, and
`verify_destination()` re-reads every entry off disk. That is a host fact, gathered after the
observation was written, about the exact bytes the scorer is about to open, and it is the fact that
matters most: it catches a tree that changed between publication and scoring.

`observation_verdict` is therefore `confirmed`/`host_facts_match` only when that comparison
succeeds, and `contradicted`/`host_facts_mismatch` when it does not — which `score.py` refuses, as
it should. There is no path here that reports agreement without having compared anything.

## The published seed

`DEV_SELFATTEST_SEED` is a constant in this repository. That is not a leak and not an oversight:
anything the development trust store accepts is forgeable by anyone who can read it, which is
exactly why `verify_signed(..., require_production_trust=True)` — the default — refuses it, why
`score.py` stamps `rankable=false` and `trust_profile="development"` on every board it produces,
and why a production bundle carries neither this module's output nor the key that verifies it.

## The `leakage` block: a scan, or the stated Development default

C2's `leakage` block is verdict-only (frozen ruling R-8) and has two verdicts, `clean` and `hit`.
Until the `leakage` parameter existed this producer wrote `clean` with zero files and zero bytes on
every record, without scanning anything. That default is unchanged, byte for byte, when
the parameter is omitted, so the Development bundles already staged keep producing the records they
produce today; zero scanned files is how such a record says that no scan ran.

Given a `LeakageScan`, every record's block comes from a real scan instead:

* the unit's published tree is scanned with `leakage.scan_tree` only after it has verified against
  its persisted C3 descriptor, under that descriptor's own `limits_applied`. The bounds the
  sanitizer held the tree to are the bounds it is scanned under, so a profile that allows more
  output (a larger per-file bound) is scanned whole rather than refused at a fixed 64 MiB;
* the tree is verified again after the scan, so the verdict is about the bytes the scorer reads;
* a unit that published nothing gets the empty-tree verdict, zero files and zero bytes;
* a registry entry that is present in the unit's own input tree (the directory mounted into its
  container as `/input`) is left out of that unit's scan. Every unit's card carries its own canary,
  and some tracks repeat it in files the agent reads, so an agent that writes its own input back
  into its output would otherwise be reported as contaminated by a canary it was handed. The same entry
  in any other unit's output is still a hit;
* when no verdict can be established -- the tree did not verify, the scan could not read it whole,
  the input tree could not be read -- the unit gets NO record and a stated reason. It never gets a
  `clean` one. A missing C2 is an organizer fault in `score.py`, which is the correct reading of a
  run whose output we could not examine.

The registry is organizer-only. Nothing here returns, prints or raises a registry entry, and a
`LeakageScan`'s `repr` does not show one.

    is missing for any other reason (a create that timed out, an image the Hub could not inspect
    after a container ran, a refusal the Hub charged to us) is not this, and files no record.

    DERIVED from the hub's own golden fixture rather than written out here. Each track's fixture
    already carries every track-specific key the C1 parser requires -- T2's grid and normalization,
    T3's repeat policy and aggregation, T4's scoring params and entity roster -- and a plan
    assembled from scratch in a bundle generator would be a second copy of a hub-owned document,
    drifting from the first the moment either changed. What varies here is the roster, the phase,
    the identifiers, and the coding track's attempt shape.

    The signature is the published DEVELOPMENT organizer key, so `verify_signature(...,
    require_production_trust=True)` -- the default everywhere else -- refuses it, and `score.py`
    stamps `rankable=false` / `trust_profile="development"` on any board it produces.

    `phase` is the plan's `phase`, `"dev"` unless a caller names another, such as `"final"`: the
    same template, the same entries and the same development signature, in the phase its
    descriptors and roster belong to. Nothing else in the body depends on it. A sealed phase still
    holds its roster to the opaque handle grammar (C1 1.1.0), which the C1 parser enforces below,
    before this returns.
