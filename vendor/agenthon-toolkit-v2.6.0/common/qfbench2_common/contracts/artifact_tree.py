"""C3 — the sanitized participant artifact tree: four roots, closed node types, counts-only rejections.

## Executive summary (read this first)

**The architectural ruling is what actually closes A04:** the participant's output directory and
the scoring program's input directory are no longer the same directory. Today `out_dir` is mounted
into the container *and* is `res/<unit>/`, with `ref/` as its sibling — measured to allow a relative
symlink from `res/` into `ref/`, for which `Path.is_file()` returns `True`, so the usual `is_file()`
guard does not protect. Five roots under one validated worker root replace that:

| Root | Written by | Readable by |
|---|---|---|
| `control/` | Runner helper (C2) | scorer (read-only) |
| `raw/` | **participant** | Runner helper only — never the scorer |
| `sanitized/` | Runner helper (copied bytes) | scorer (read-only) |
| `reference/` | organizer | scorer (read-only) |
| `results/` | verifier/checker | Hub C4 assembly |

This module owns the *policy*, not the walk. The OS-level materialization (a directory-FD-relative
no-follow walk, the copy, the deletion of `raw/`) belongs to the Runner; what lives here is the set
of predicates the walk must call, so that five workstreams cannot each invent their own answer to
"what counts as a malicious tree". Feed it `NodeObservation`s built from `os.lstat` and it returns
the verdict.

Frozen requirements encoded here:

* symlinks, hard links (`st_nlink > 1`), FIFOs, sockets, devices and every other non-regular node
  are rejected — *by type*, before anything opens them;
* exact allowed relative paths, normalized components, depth, count, per-file and total size, and
  a sparse-allocation bound;
* setuid/setgid/sticky bits are a **counted** rejection (`mode_unsafe`), not a raise. The copy into
  a fresh 0o644 file drops the bit either way; what the code buys is that the descriptor's
  per-code rows show the refusal happened, which a raise on the way past never did;
* rejection on **NFC collision and on case-insensitive collision** (`digest.digest_tree` enforces
  the same rule on the descriptor, so a tree cannot pass one gate and fail the other);
* hashes are over **copied bytes**, never over a participant path target;
* `rejections` carries **counts only** — the schema has no path field at all, so a careless caller
  cannot echo an attacker-controlled path into an operator log;
* `reference_reachable_from_c3` is recorded as an **asserted test result**, and `True` is an
  organizer fault rather than a note.

> **Binding test-environment caveat.** The case-collision and Unicode-collision cases cannot be
> constructed on macOS — APFS folds both — while the Linux workers do not. Those two must be
> exercised in Linux CI, and A06 may not be closed on a green local run.
