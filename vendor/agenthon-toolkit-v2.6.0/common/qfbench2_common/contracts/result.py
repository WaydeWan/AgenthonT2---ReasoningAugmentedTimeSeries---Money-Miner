"""C4 — the scorer result, the closed public detail, and the fixed-denominator aggregate.

## Executive summary (read this first)

C4 is what a scorer says about one unit, and what the driver says about a submission. Two frozen
rulings shape it:

1. **C1 is authoritative for failure *treatment*; C4 merely reports the *code*.** A track scorer
   cannot override the signed plan. `Aggregate.from_results` asks the plan for the value.
2. **The public projection of `detail` is a closed schema: enum code plus integer counts only.**
   No free-form strings. This concretely removes `note` and `resolves_after` from the old
   `_WHY_KEYS` allowlist — `note` is arbitrary participant-influenced text and `resolves_after` is
   the channel by which a sealed Track 2 target date reaches a public artifact. `public_detail_keys`
   is the shared function so all consumers use one allowlist rather than four copies.

The aggregate is **"mean over the C1 roster"**, in those words. It carries `n_expected`,
`n_scored`, `n_participant_failure`, `n_organizer_failure` and **refuses to emit when they do not
sum to `n_expected`**. That refusal is A01: the pre-fix driver averaged only the admissible units,
so answering 2 of 4 scored `1.0000` while answering all 4 honestly scored `0.5000`.

Other frozen rules encoded here:

* `organizer_failure` is expressible at **whole-evaluation scope**, not only per unit: an organizer
  fault aborts rather than producing a partial leaderboard.
* Non-finite values in participant **data** are a participant failure; non-finite intermediate
  **statistics** are an organizer failure.
* Participant-visible rows use **opaque unit handles**, never sealed unit ids.
* A result carries `run_record_digest` and `sanitized_tree_digest`, not only the inputs, so an
  aggregate can prove which evidence produced which row.
