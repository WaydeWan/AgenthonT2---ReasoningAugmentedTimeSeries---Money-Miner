"""Contract errors and the strict accessor.

## Executive summary (read this first)

Global rule 0.1 of the frozen contract set says: **an absent field is an error, never a satisfied
constraint.** This module is the mechanical form of that sentence. `req(obj, key)` reads a field and
raises when it is missing; there is no defaulting accessor anywhere in `qfbench2_common.contracts`,
and `dict.get(key, default)` against a contract object is a defect.

Three exception types, and the distinction between them is the whole fault-attribution model:

* `ContractError`   — the bytes do not form the contract. Neither side is blamed yet.
* `ParticipantFailure` — the participant's own artifact is at fault. Consumes the C1 failure score,
  stays in the C1 denominator.
* `OrganizerFault`  — organizer or infrastructure is at fault. Produces **no** participant score;
  at whole-evaluation scope it aborts rather than publishing a partial leaderboard.

`ParticipantFailure` and `OrganizerFault` both derive from `ContractError` so a caller that only
wants "this did not parse" can catch one type, while a caller that must attribute blame catches the
two subtypes *first*. Order your `except` clauses accordingly.
