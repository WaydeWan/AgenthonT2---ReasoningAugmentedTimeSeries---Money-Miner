"""The worker heartbeat — a signed preflight report bound to one C7 instance.

## Executive summary (read this first)

A queue that exists and has no worker accepts submissions and never runs them. A queue that has a
worker running the *wrong* image, the wrong runtime, or with no scratch root accepts submissions
and runs them wrongly. Neither state is visible from the platform's own view of the queue, so the
C8 publish gate needs evidence from the other end of it: a document the worker itself produced,
signed, saying what it found when it looked at its own host.

That document is `WorkerHeartbeat`, and this module is where it lives.

### Why the shape lives here

The Runner produces this document and the CodaBench publish gate consumes it, which makes it an
interface between two programs rather than a local evidence object belonging to either. A shape
defined in the consumer is a shape the producer has to reverse-engineer from the consumer's parser,
so it is defined here, once, for both.

Three things follow from defining it here, each for a stated reason:

* the version field is `schema_version` (`"1.0.0"`), matching every other contract document,
  rather than a bespoke `schema: "agenthon2026.worker_heartbeat/1"` string;
* `worker_image_digest` and `c7_instance_digest` go through `parse_digest`, so a non-digest cannot
  be recorded in a field whose entire job is to be compared to a digest;
* the *compatibility* rules — does this heartbeat describe the instance it claims to describe? —
  moved onto the object as `compatibility_objections()`, so the Runner can check its own report
  before signing it instead of discovering the mismatch in someone else's publish gate.

### What binds it

`c7_instance_digest` is `HardwareInstance.instance_digest` — the JCS digest of the C7 body without
its signature, the same value C2 binds in `bindings.c7_instance_digest`. That is the whole point of
the binding: a heartbeat is not evidence about "a worker on queue X", it is evidence about *the
host described by this exact C7 document*. Edit one provenance field in C7 and every heartbeat
bound to the old body stops matching, which is the correct outcome — the operator changed what they
were claiming about the hardware and the worker has not re-attested to the new claim.

Verification is the frozen §0.5 envelope over the document minus `signature`, so
`verify_signed_object(doc, trust_store, purpose="heartbeat")` is the whole of it: a store that
binds key purposes (every production store) refuses a call that names none, and a key it does not
trust for heartbeats. An empty trust store fails closed, exactly as everywhere else.
