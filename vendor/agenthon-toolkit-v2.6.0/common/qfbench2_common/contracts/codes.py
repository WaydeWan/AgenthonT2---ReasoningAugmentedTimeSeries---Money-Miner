"""The closed C4 public failure-code enum and its versioned registry.

## Executive summary (read this first)

Thirteen codes. The set is closed (global rule 0.3): an unrecognized value is an error, never an
"unknown/other" bucket, and a track cannot add a fourteenth without a registry version bump. The
first eleven were adopted verbatim in §5 of the contract freeze.

### Registry 1.1.0 adds `domain_gate_failed`

The frozen eleven had no code for *"the output was well-formed and then failed a published
domain-admissibility gate"* — a stylized-fact ceiling, a calibration check, a citation-faithfulness
threshold, an entity-roster mismatch, an invalid interval, a nonfinite value in participant data,
evidence of an unsupported kind. Every one of those was reported as `schema_invalid`, whose gloss
tells the participant their output "did not match the published output schema". For most of them
that sentence is simply false, and a participant reading it goes looking for a schema defect that
does not exist. Two tracks asked for the code independently, and this module's own consumer
(`failure_labels.DEFAULT_ADMISSIBILITY_CODE`) carried a comment calling `schema_invalid` "the
least-wrong of eleven".

Adding a row is a registry version bump and nothing else: the C4 *document* shape is unchanged, so
a 1.0.0 result document is still valid. What changes is that a consumer with a hard-coded copy of
the enum will refuse a result carrying the new value — which is the closed-enum rule working, and
the reason the version moved. See `contracts/MIGRATIONS.md`.

### Registry 1.2.0 adds `not_reached` (the stage clock ends mid-roster)

A phase has a total wall-clock allowance for the whole roster (`execution_time_limit`, 43,200 s on
Development), and it is separate from the per-unit ceiling. When a run spends it
before the last unit, the ingestion program stops leasing and the units it never started have no
run record at all, so the whole run used to end `Failed` with no score, although the units that ran
had been answered.

A unit the run did not reach is an unanswered unit and counts as not passed -- the same
fixed-denominator rule the Track 1 README already publishes for a missing output. None of the
twelve earlier codes says that. `resource_timeout` comes closest and its gloss is "Your container did
not finish within the unit's wall-clock budget", which is false: there was no container. That is
exactly the `schema_invalid`-as-"least-wrong" problem registry 1.1.0 was created to fix, so this
takes the same route rather than repeating it.

`scored` is `true`, like every other public code: the unit keeps its slot in the C1 denominator and
receives the committed worst-case score `W`. `phase_scope` is `ingestion`, because the ingestion
stage is what observes the allowance ending.

The registry ships as a **fixture**, not as prose, so the website generates participant-facing
wording from the same bytes the scorer uses instead of paraphrasing it. Each row is exactly
`{code, phase_scope, one_line_participant_gloss, scored}`:

* `code` — the enum value. Participant-visible.
* `phase_scope` — **the PIPELINE stage, ratified.** The value set is `ingestion | execution |
  scoring`: the stage of the evaluation pipeline that may emit the code. It is **not** the
  competition phase (`dev | final | verification`), and the name's resemblance to `phase` is the
  only reason anybody reads it that way.

  The reading is settled, not inferred, and the reason is drift: the competition phase already
  lives in C1 (`plan.phase`), which is signed and covers the whole evaluation. A per-code copy of
  it would be a second place to write the same fact, and two places eventually disagree — a
  registry row still saying `final` while the plan it is scored against says `verification` is a
  contradiction nothing in the system can adjudicate. There is exactly one competition phase per
  evaluation and it is not a property of a failure code.

  A code emitted outside its pipeline scope is an organizer fault, because it means the stage that
  produced it was not the stage that observed the fact.
* `one_line_participant_gloss` — the exact sentence a participant reads. No sealed identifiers, no
  free-form detail, no path.
* `scored` — whether the unit still occupies its slot in the C1 denominator and receives the
  committed worst-case score `W`.

**Every public code has `scored = true`, and `test_codes.py` asserts it.** That is A01 stated as
data: a `scored: false` public code would be a supported way to drop a unit from the denominator,
which is the exploit this program exists to remove. An organizer fault is not in this enum at all —
it aborts the evaluation instead of scoring a unit.
