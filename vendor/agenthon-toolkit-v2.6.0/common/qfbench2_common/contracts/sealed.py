"""C6 — the sealed dataset pointer, split into a public handle and a signed resolver descriptor.

## Executive summary (read this first)

C6 is **split in two**, and the split is the security property:

* **`SealedHandle`** ships in the bundle. It carries `schema_version`, track, phase, dataset
  version and an opaque pointer id — *nothing else*. A bundle never carries a digest or a roster
  count, so a participant reading the bundle learns nothing about the sealed set's size or content.
  The key set is exact, so a producer cannot "helpfully" attach a digest: an extra key is a parse
  error.
* **`ResolverDescriptor`** lives resolver-side, is signed, and holds digests, sizes, the roster
  commitment, resolver identity and the artifact roles.

**Role enum, three values, mutually exclusive:** `participant_input`, `scorer_reference`,
`verifier_asset`. **One object may not carry two roles.** Track 1 and Track 4 asked for this
independently; it is the schema-level statement of the firewall, and `role` is a single string
rather than a list precisely so "both" is unrepresentable.

Further frozen fields:

* `required: bool` per artifact, and a **null or empty digest is forbidden**.
* `answer_equivalent: bool` — set on any derived artifact that inverts to the answer. Track 2's
  `ref_scale.json` is the known instance: it is *derived*, looks innocuous, and inverts to the
  sealed target. Flagging it in the schema is what stops it being classified `participant_input`
  by someone who reads only the filename. This module refuses that combination outright.
* The Track 4 **corpus manifest is a first-class C6 artifact** mapping
  `doc_id -> {digest, trusted doc_date}`, so citation resolution is a dictionary lookup and never
  participant path interpolation.
* **Input and reference may never resolve from the same unresolved source** — enforced on the uri
  *and* the digest, because a redirect defeats a string comparison alone.
