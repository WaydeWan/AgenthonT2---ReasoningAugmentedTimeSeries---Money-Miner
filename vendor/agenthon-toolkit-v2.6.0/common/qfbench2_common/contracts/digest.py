"""RFC 8785 (JCS) canonicalization and the one way a digest is computed.

## Executive summary (read this first)

Global rule 0.2 of the frozen contract set: **digests are computed one way** — `sha256` over the
RFC 8785 JSON Canonicalization Scheme serialization of the named structure, with paths inside any
digested structure NFC-normalized and sorted code-point ascending. "Whatever `json.dumps` did" is
explicitly ruled out, because two independent implementations must agree byte-for-byte or every
sealed phase becomes an organizer fault.

Three public entry points:

* `jcs_canonical(obj) -> bytes`      the canonical serialization itself
* `digest_json(obj) -> "sha256:..."` sha256 of that serialization
* `digest_tree(entries) -> "sha256:..."` the C3 sanitized-tree digest

### What JCS actually requires, and where the traps are

1. **Object keys sort by UTF-16 code unit**, not by code point. For everything in the Basic
   Multilingual Plane the two agree; they disagree for astral characters (U+1F600 sorts *before*
   U+FF01 by code unit and *after* it by code point). Implemented by sorting on
   `key.encode("utf-16-be")`.
2. **Strings are emitted as UTF-8, not `\\u`-escaped.** Only `"`, `\\` and C0 controls are escaped,
   using the short forms `\\b \\f \\n \\r \\t` where they exist and `\\u00xx` otherwise. Python's
   `json.dumps` defaults to `ensure_ascii=True`, which is wrong here.
3. **Numbers use the ECMAScript `Number::toString` grammar**, which is *not* Python's `repr`.
   Python writes `1e+16` where ECMAScript writes `10000000000000000`, and Python writes `1e-05`
   where ECMAScript writes `0.00001`. `_es_number` implements the ES algorithm on top of Python's
   shortest round-trip digits.
4. **NaN and infinity are not JSON numbers** and are refused rather than emitted as literals.
5. `1` and `1.0` are the *same* number and serialize identically to `1`. That is what makes the
   round-trip property tests meaningful: differently shaped inputs must produce one digest.

### The tree digest preimage is fixed, deliberately

`digest_tree` refuses an entry that does not carry exactly
`{path, size_bytes, sha256, mode_bits, num_rows}`. A digest whose preimage depends on which
optional keys a producer happened to include is not a digest two implementations can agree on, so
`num_rows` is required-and-nullable (`null` for anything that is not parquet) rather than optional.
