"""One timestamp grammar for every contract: RFC 3339, UTC, explicit `Z`.

This is a module rather than a convention for a measured reason. A bare `YYYY-MM-DD` compared
lexically against a value of another type raised an uncaught `TypeError` on live input, and under
the pre-fix scoring driver an uncaught exception aborted the whole run. Contract timestamps are
therefore parsed into `datetime` objects with a fixed grammar, never compared as strings.
