"""C1 — the Evaluation Plan, and the two functions every track calls.

## Executive summary (read this first)

C1 is the pre-committed, signed statement of *what will be scored and how failure is treated*. It
exists because of A01: before it, the aggregate was a mean over whatever the participant happened
to make admissible, so answering only the two easy units out of four scored `1.0000` while an
honest run over all four scored `0.5000`. C1 fixes the denominator to the committed roster.

Two functions carry the frozen ruling R-2 and are called by all four tracks:

* `plan.failure_score_for(code)` — the pre-committed worst-case value `W` a failed unit contributes.
* `plan.clip(score)` — a real per-unit score clamped into the same domain.

Both halves are required. A bare penalty is still exploitable: if `W` is *better* than an
attainable real score, a participant improves the aggregate by deliberately failing a unit they
would have scored worse on. Clipping is what makes failure never strictly better than any real
outcome. `clip_real_scores_to_domain` must therefore be `true` for a rankable plan, and `clip()`
refuses to run on a plan that disclaims it rather than silently clamping anyway.

### The frozen per-track values

| Track | direction | domain | W |
|---|---|---|---|
| coding | desc | [0.0, 1.0] | 0.0 per (unit, slot); denominator `T x n` |
| forecasting | asc | [0.0, 4.0] normalized composite | 4.0 (M0 baseline = 1.0) |
| simulation | desc | [0.0, published clip max] | 0.0 events/sec |
| analysis | desc | [0.0, 1.0] | 0.0 = `0*w_a + 0*w_c` (Track-4 scorer 5.1.0; plans minted for scorer <= 5.0.0 carry [-0.27, 1.0] and -0.27 = `0*w_a - w_c*interval_level`) |

`W` is validated to be the **worst end of the declared domain** for the declared direction — the
minimum for `desc`, the maximum for `asc`. A plan whose `W` sits inside its own domain is refused
at parse time, because such a plan is exactly the exploitable shape R-2 removes.

### Two representations

The **public commitment** ships in bundles and carries counts, digests and policy only. The
**expanded roster** carries unit identities and is resolver/scorer-only. `plan.expected_units`
raises on a public commitment rather than returning an empty tuple — an empty roster read as
"no units expected" is the A01 failure mode in a new costume.

### Sealed-phase handles are opaque, and that is a security property (new in C1 1.1.0)

A `unit_handle` is not just a key. Under the frozen worker/scoring topology it is a **directory
name** directly under the ingestion program's output root — and CodaBench uploads that root as the
submission's `prediction_result` (`compute_worker.py:1758`) and serves it back to the submitter as
a signed download URL unless the phase sets `hide_prediction_output` or `hide_output`, both of
which are `BooleanField(default=False)`. C8 1.1.0 gates the flag; C1 1.1.0 gates the name. They are
independent defences and the seal wants both, because the handle also reaches the participant
through the leaderboard and the C4 result, where no phase flag applies at all.

So for `final` and `verification`, every handle must match `^u-[0-9a-f]{8,32}$`, and the roster
must use one width throughout. `dev` keeps readable handles: nothing there is sealed, and forcing
hex on a development roster would only make organizer debugging worse.

`derive_opaque_roster(sealed_ids, phase_salt=...)` is the supported way to mint them — keyed
HMAC-SHA256, stable across regenerations, and a *different* salt per phase so the same sealed unit
is unrecognisable between the dev board and the final one.

### Track 4's scoring parameters are closed, and that is arithmetic (new in C1 1.2.0)

`expected_units[].scoring_params.target_type` is `classification | regression | ranking`
(`TARGET_TYPES`) and `composite_weights` names exactly `accuracy` and `calibration`
(`COMPOSITE_WEIGHT_KEYS`), each in `[0, 1]`, summing to 1.

Both were free-form in 1.1.0 and both had already gone wrong in the shipped golden fixture, which
declared `target_type: "point_and_interval"`. Track 4 cannot score that value; its plan adapter
refuses the fixture rather than defaulting, because the pre-fix scorer's fallback was *label
accuracy*, so an unrecognized target type silently changed which metric the leaderboard reported.

The weight constraint is not tidiness either. Through Track-4 scorer 5.0.0 the analysis worst case
was `W = 0*w_accuracy - w_calibration*interval_level`, so weights summing to anything but 1 moved
the domain every real score is clipped into. From scorer 5.1.0 both composite legs are ratios in
[0, 1] and `W = 0`, but the weights must still sum to 1 for the composite to stay in [0, 1].
`metric.domain.min` must equal `participant_failure.score` (the worst end of the domain).

`contract_set` stays `"1.1.0"`: no key was added or removed, and C1 compares `contract_set`
exactly, so bumping it would refuse every plan every consumer currently produces.

### Track 4's `interval_leg` flag (new in C1 1.3.0)

`expected_units[].scoring_params.interval_leg` is an OPTIONAL boolean, default `true`. `false`
declares that a classification unit's numeric truth is only a label code, so the unit is scored on
the label alone (`w_accuracy * quality`). It is refused on any other target type, and a non-boolean
is refused rather than read as truthy. It mirrors the unit card's `[scoring.params] interval_leg`,
and Track 4 refuses a card that disagrees with the plan. The key is optional and additive, so
every 1.x plan without it still parses and still means what it meant; `contract_set` again does
not move.

### Track 4's `labels` vocabulary (C1 1.3.0)

`expected_units[].scoring_params.labels` is a classification unit's own label vocabulary
(`task.json` -> `target.labels`): two or more unique, non-empty strings without surrounding
whitespace. It is REQUIRED on a classification unit from C1 1.3.0 (`LABELS_REQUIRED_FROM`) and
validated whenever present at any version; it is FORBIDDEN on regression and ranking units at
every version (`LABELLED_TARGET_TYPES`). A 1.2.0 or 1.1.0 classification entry without it still
parses. `labels` and `interval_leg` are independent: a 1.3.0 plan may carry either or both.

    It is vacuous as frozen, and that is the whole reason it is nailed shut rather than left to
    look useful. Three frozen rules meet on it: `score` must equal `W`, the worst end of the metric
    domain; an override must lie *within* the domain; and an override may never be *better* than
    `W`. On a domain whose worst end is `W`, the only value satisfying all three is `W` itself — so
    every legal `by_code` entry is a restatement of `score`, and no entry can change any outcome.

    The two obvious alternatives are both worse. Deleting the field forecloses a v1.1 that genuinely
    needs per-code treatment and breaks every plan document that already writes `{}`. Leaving it
    parseable-but-useless ships a field that *looks* like a leniency lever — a reviewer, or an
    organizer under deadline pressure, reads `by_code` and reasonably concludes some failure modes
    can be scored more kindly. A field that looks adjustable but is not is a fail-open invitation,
    so a non-empty `by_code` is refused outright with the reasoning in the message.
