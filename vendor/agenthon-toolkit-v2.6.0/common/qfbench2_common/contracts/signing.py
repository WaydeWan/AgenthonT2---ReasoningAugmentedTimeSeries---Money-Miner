"""The frozen signature envelope, the trust store, and fail-closed verification.

## Executive summary (read this first)

Global rule 0.5: *"Signature envelope is fixed now; key custody is not."* Every signed contract
object carries `{alg: "Ed25519", key_id, payload_digest, signed_at, signature}`. The Hub verifies
against a configurable trust store, and **an empty or unconfigured trust store means verification
fails, which means not rankable.** That is the frozen fail-closed default, and it is the single
most important line in this file: there is no code path in which a missing trust store is treated
as "nothing to check".

Four ways verification can be refused, all of them raising `SignatureUnverifiable`:

1. **No verifier configured** — the trust store is empty. Callers treat this as *not rankable*,
   never as *verified*.
2. **Not trusted** — the store has keys but not this `key_id`, or the store is a development
   store and the caller asked for production trust.
3. **Not trusted for this purpose** — the store binds the key to purposes, and the document being
   verified is not one of them (see "Key purposes" below).
4. **Not valid** — the payload digest does not match the payload, the timestamp is outside the
   replay window, or the Ed25519 check fails.

Decision D7 (who holds the attestation key, what the scoring image's trust store contains, how
rotation and revocation reach an offline container, and what the replay window is) belongs to a
named human security owner. Nothing here waits on it: the shape is frozen, the default is closed,
and the value is supplied later.

### Key purposes

A trust store maps `key_id` to a public key. Without more, every key in it verifies every kind of
signed document: a run-record key on a fleet host could sign an evaluation plan, and the scorer
would accept it. So a store may bind each key to the purposes it is trusted for, and every
verification names the purpose it verifies for:

| Purpose | Verifies |
|---|---|
| `c1` | C1 evaluation plans, the Track 2 forecast protocol, the stage-budget policy |
| `c2` | C2 run records, and the run-time receipts that bind them |
| `c6` | C6 sealed-dataset resolver descriptors |
| `c7` | C7 hardware instances |
| `c8` | C8 release evidence |
| `heartbeat` | worker heartbeats |
| `archive` | the Track 2 close archive manifest |

* **A production store must bind every key.** `purposes` is required when `profile` is
  `production` and the store holds any key, and a production verification names its purpose or
  is refused.
* **A development store may bind none,** and then every key verifies every document, exactly as
  before. That keeps every Development artifact, and the trust store every Development bundle
  ships, byte-identical. A development store that does bind purposes is held to them.
* **Host keys sign only host evidence.** `c2` and `heartbeat` are signed by keys that live on fleet
  hosts. A key holding either may hold no other purpose, so no host key can sign a plan, a hardware
  instance, a release or an archive.

The purpose is a property of the trust store and of the verifier, not of the signature: the frozen
envelope is unchanged, and so is every signature already made.

### Backend

`cryptography` is used when it is installed, for verification and for signing; otherwise the
pure-Python RFC 8032 implementation in `_ed25519.py` is used. Ed25519 is deterministic, so both
backends produce the same signature for the same seed and message. **No dependency was added to
`qfbench2-common`** — adding a compiled dependency that four track repos and the scoring image must
install is a supply-chain decision for the project owner. A production signer
that holds a real key passes `require_constant_time=True` to refuse the pure-Python fallback, whose
scalar multiplication branches on the secret. `ed25519_backend()` reports which
backend is live so a C2 or C8 producer can record it.
