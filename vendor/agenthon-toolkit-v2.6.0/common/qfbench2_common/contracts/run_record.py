"""C2 — the trusted run record, and the rankable/failed distinction that kept being misread.

## Executive summary (read this first)

C2 is what the *organizer's* infrastructure observed while a participant container ran. It exists
because scoring previously read exactly two directories and no authenticated runtime fact,
so a unit whose container never launched was indistinguishable from a unit the participant
chose not to answer.

**The single most misread part of the draft, now structural:** `rankability` replaces the old
`rankable` boolean and describes the *trusted execution profile*, not whether participant code
succeeded. An ordinary participant timeout under a valid production profile is
`rankability.state = "rankable"` **and** `participant_outcome = "failure"`: it consumes the C1
penalty and stays in the denominator. Those are two orthogonal axes and this module refuses to
collapse them.

Other frozen rules encoded here:

* **Fault attribution reads only channels the participant cannot write** — the daemon's
  `State.Status`/`State.Error` and `docker create` stderr, which precedes any participant process.
  Never the exit code alone, never container stderr, never a `docker info` probe.
  `derive_participant_outcome` is the helper; a record whose declared outcome disagrees with it
  cannot be constructed.
* **`leakage` is verdict-only** (R-8). The key set is exact, so a producer physically cannot attach
  the matched canary token to a record: an extra key is a parse error, not an ignored field.
* **GPUs are named by UUID, never by index** (R-5). A bare `"0"` in the applied GPU slot is
  refused.
* **Timing is host-measured.** `elapsed_sec` is cross-checked against `ended_at - started_at`, so a
  participant-reported figure smuggled into the field does not survive parsing.
* **A participant file can never become C2.** This type carries no filesystem loader that reads
  from a participant-writable root; C2 exists only as a Runner-signed artifact in the organizer
  control root.
* **The attestation payload is frozen** (see `attestation_payload`): the signature covers the JCS
  digest of the whole record minus `attestation.signature`. Before that was written down, no module
  computed the digest and no test checked it, which made `payload_digest` decorative — a field an
  auditor would read as evidence and a producer could fill with anything.
* **`oom_killed` comes from the daemon's `State.OOMKilled`**, a channel the participant cannot
  write. Without it an out-of-memory kill is byte-indistinguishable from an ordinary nonzero exit,
  so the C4 code `resource_oom` could not be emitted truthfully by anybody.
* **`operator_override` is a first-class applied-source** and is never rankable. The one downgrade
  this system performs — `QFBENCH_ALLOW_NO_EVAL_NETWORK` running a `restricted` card offline — was
  previously recorded as `daemon_default`, which is false: no daemon default was consulted, an
  operator made a choice. A record that lies to an auditor is worse than one that admits a gap.

### New in C2 1.3.0 — a signed participant refusal

`participant_refusal` is the Runner's signed verdict on the OUTPUT of a run the daemon saw exit 0
cleanly: no stable output, no readable trace, an invalid sidecar, repeats whose stable outputs
differ, or a tree the sanitizer refused. Daemon facts alone derive such a run as `success`, so
before 1.3.0 no signed record could state the failure and the Runner could only hold the unit as
the organizer's. Every 1.3.0 record carries the member: `null`, or one code from the closed set
`PARTICIPANT_REFUSAL_CODES`. A code is the one fact besides the daemon's that makes
`participant_outcome` a `failure`, and it is refused on a record that attributes the run to the
organizer (`execution_fault` infrastructure or `organizer_failure`) or whose lifecycle already
derives a failure. `PARTICIPANT_REFUSAL_FAILURE_CODES` names the public failure code each is
scored as; the failure-code registry is unchanged. 1.1.0 and 1.2.0 records are read exactly as
before. See `MIGRATIONS.md`.

### New in C2 1.2.0 — bounded host execution faults

`execution_fault` records a diagnosis derived from host lifecycle facts. Create timeouts and
unconfirmed cleanup select `organizer_failure`, including when all execution controls were met.
The completion outcome remains a separate axis. Legacy 1.1.0 records remain readable without
changing their signed bytes; an absent fault field is unknown evidence. See `MIGRATIONS.md` for
the reader-first rollout and the initial vocabulary's limits.

### New in C2 1.1.0 — two facts that were previously unsayable

Both were requested by the Runner, and both have the same shape: the contract could express the
*good* outcome and not the *honest* one, so a producer facing reality had to choose between lying
and withholding evidence.

* **`observation_contradicted`** joins `rankability.unmet_controls`. A Runner that checks the
  Hub's unsigned `observation` against host facts and finds them disagreeing can now sign a record
  saying exactly that. Parsing enforces the pairing: `observation_verdict = "contradicted"`
  without the control does not parse, so the contradiction cannot be recorded and shrugged off.
* **`applied.gpu.selector`** — `uuid`, `index`, `all`, or `null` for "no device applied" — records
  HOW the device was chosen. C2 1.0.0 refused an index-looking applied value outright, which meant
  a Runner watching the daemon apply a device by index had to stay silent, and silence was
  byte-identical to a CPU-only unit. `index` and `all` each force `gpu_device_unpinned`, so R-5 is
  still enforced; what changed is that the violation is now *recorded* instead of *unrepresentable*.

    field saw a cryptographic commitment where there was only a well-formed string. A signature
    over an unspecified payload is decorative, and a decorative signature is worse than none: it
    invites exactly the reliance it cannot support.

    The excluded set is exactly one field. An earlier version of this contract excluded the whole
    `attestation` block, which left `observation_verdict` and `reason` OUTSIDE the signature --
    so anyone able to edit the JSON could flip a Runner verdict of `contradicted` to `confirmed`
    and the signature would still verify. That is the one claim the attestation exists to make, so
    leaving it unbound defeated the mechanism. Now the block is bound and only the signature itself
    is removed, for the single unavoidable reason that no structure can contain a digest of itself.

    Bound, therefore: every binding, the lifecycle, the applied controls, the timing, the telemetry,
    the leakage verdict, the Hub's unsigned `observation`, AND the Runner's `observation_verdict`
    and `reason`. Mutating any of them invalidates the signature.
