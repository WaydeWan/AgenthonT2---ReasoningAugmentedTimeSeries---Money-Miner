"""Golden C1-C8 fixtures, shipped **inside the package** so every repo consumes the same bytes.

## Executive summary (read this first)

CodaBench ships the C5 fixtures verbatim as its generated examples and the website renders from the
same files. Nobody hand-writes a third example — that is how the generated-example drift happened.
`load_fixture("c5/coding_dev.json")` is the supported way to read one.

Everything here is **synthetic**. Team ids are `team-example-*`, image digests are constructed hex,
and unit handles are opaque `u-<hex>` strings derived by `derive_opaque_roster` from the synthetic
ids in `FIXTURE_SEALED_IDS`. No sealed unit id, target value, canary, roster entry or credential
appears in any file.

### The dev signing key is public and forgeable, on purpose

The signed fixtures (C1, C6, C7, C8) carry real Ed25519 envelopes produced by the **development**
key whose seed is the constant below. That is what makes the fixtures verifiable end to end in a
test instead of carrying a placeholder that proves nothing. Because the seed is public, anything the
dev trust store accepts is forgeable, so `verify_signed(..., require_production_trust=True)` — the
default — refuses it. Production must never load `dev_trust_store.json`.

#: phase, where no Runner exists. One key for both would make those two producers indistinguishable
#: in the artifact, and "who signed this" is the only question the key id answers.
#:
