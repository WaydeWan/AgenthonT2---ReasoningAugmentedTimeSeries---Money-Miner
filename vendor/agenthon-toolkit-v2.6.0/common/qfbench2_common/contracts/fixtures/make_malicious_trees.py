"""Generate the shared malicious-output conformance corpus.

Every workstream in the remediation program needs the same adversarial filesystem cases: Hub (C3
primitives), Runner (materialization), CodaBench (two-stage topology), and Tracks 1-4 (parsers).
Five separately-invented corpora would disagree about what "should fail" means, and a case that one
repo omits is exactly the case that ships. So the corpus is generated from one script, and the
expected verdict for each case is data, not prose.

The trees cannot be committed to git: git stores a symlink but not a FIFO, a socket, a sparse file,
or a case/Unicode collision that the checkout filesystem folds. Generating them makes the corpus
portable and makes each case's construction auditable.

    python make_malicious_trees.py --out /tmp/corpus          # build every buildable case
    python make_malicious_trees.py --out /tmp/corpus --json   # emit the expectation manifest only

Layout mirrors the real scoring namespace, because several cases are only dangerous in that shape:

    <out>/<case>/input/ref/<unit>/    grader reference tree (holds the sentinel)
    <out>/<case>/input/res/<unit>/    participant output tree (holds the attack)

CONTAINS NO SEALED DATA. The only "secret" is the synthetic sentinel below, which exists so a test
can assert that a scorer never read it.
