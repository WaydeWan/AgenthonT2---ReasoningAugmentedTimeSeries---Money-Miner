"""C8 — the release evidence manifest. Strict parsing is normative.

## Executive summary (read this first)

One signed file with a `covers` block naming exact competition ids and artifact digests. **Every
boolean is a JSON boolean, and any string in a boolean position is a hard failure** — no
truthy/falsey strings. `strict_bool` is what makes that mechanical rather than aspirational.

Required beyond the draft, each row for a measured reason:

* `hub_source_sha`, `bundle_digests` per uploaded program/dataset zip, and a **distribution
  digest** — the built wheel's sha256 — for `qfbench2-common`, **never a version string.** A
  modified vendored fork imported from `PYTHONPATH` reported the version of an unrelated
  distribution, because `importlib.metadata` resolves the *distribution*, not the imported module.
  A version string is unfalsifiable by construction.
* `skipped_required_jobs` as an **integer asserted to be 0**, evaluated on **step** conclusions,
  not job conclusions: a green job can contain skipped steps, which is exactly the observed
  skipped-green defect. The field records which granularity was used and refuses `job`.
* Dataset-firewall attestation **per unit family**, not per repository: the exec family differs in
  anatomy from the analysis family, and a repository-level attestation hides that.
* `deployed_site`, `policy_documents`, and a `fact_matrix` where publication **fails when any row's
  `last_verified` predates its cited evidence**.
* An explicit `backend_security_review` row: the Django backend is outside the audited repository,
  so C8 blocks until its source has been reviewed.

## New in C8 1.1.0 — `phase_visibility`, and why a platform default became a contract field

Verified in the vendored upstream CodaBench source:

* `compute_worker.py:1758` — `self._put_dir(self.prediction_result, self.output_dir)`. The
  **ingestion program's output directory** is uploaded as the submission's `prediction_result`.
* `compute_worker.py:1371` — `bundles += [(self.prediction_result, "input/res")]`. It is
  downloaded back as `input/res` for the scoring step, which is how the frozen topology works.
* `src/apps/api/serializers/submissions.py:263` — `get_prediction_result` returns a **signed
  download URL** to the submitter unless `phase.hide_output` **or** `phase.hide_prediction_output`.
* `src/apps/competitions/models.py:311-312` — both of those are `BooleanField(default=False)`.

So under default phase settings a participant can download the entire ingestion output root. Under
the frozen topology that root contains `_control/` — the signed C2 run records, the Hub's unsigned
observations and the ingestion logs — and one directory per unit named by its roster handle. In a
sealed phase those directory names *are* the sealed roster, and the C2 records enumerate exactly
which controls were not established, which is an attack roadmap rather than an inconvenience.

There is no alternative placement. The scoring program receives `input/ref` and `input/res` and
nothing else, so organizer evidence the scorer must read has to travel inside the ingestion output
root. The fix is therefore not to move `_control/` but to make its exposure impossible **by gate
rather than by default**, which is what this block is: the observed value of each flag, recorded
per scored phase, in a signed manifest, checked before publication.

Two severities, because the two flags do different things:

* **Both false is a parse refusal.** That is the leak itself, and a document describing it is not
  evidence of a safe release; it is a description of an unsafe one. It does not parse.
* **`hide_prediction_output` false on a scored phase blocks publication** even when `hide_output`
  is true. `hide_output` also suppresses the logs, the leaderboard and `scoring_result`
  (serializer lines 253, 271, 277), so satisfying the gate that way costs participants everything
  they are supposed to receive — and the operator who notices will fix it by flipping `hide_output`
  back off, which reinstates the leak. The ruling is `hide_prediction_output = true`; the gate
  enforces the ruling, not merely the absence of the leak.

`hide_score_output` is deliberately **not** recorded. It gates `scoring_result`, which participants
are supposed to get; it plays no part in this leak, and a field recorded here would read as one
more knob to tighten.
