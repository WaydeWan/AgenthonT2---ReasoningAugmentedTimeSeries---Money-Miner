"""qfbench2-common — the shared evaluation harness for Agenthon 2026 / QFBench 2.0.

The SAME package is pip-installed (pinned at a tagged release of the main repo) by every
track repo, public and private, so dev-phase smoke tests and final-phase sealed scoring
run identical code.

Modules:
    contracts       the frozen C1-C8 interface (contract set 1.1.0) — start here
    taskcard        parse + validate card.toml (task-card v2)
    manifest        per-file checksum / license / public-safety checks
    leakage         cutoff, embargo, network-isolation, verdict-only canary scanning
    verifier        hierarchical admissibility gates -> score
    failure_labels  cross-track failure-mode taxonomy + JSONL reporter
    smoke           public smoke-test runner
    scoring/        per-track metrics (passk, crps, stylized_facts, faithfulness, bootstrap)

## Build identity (frozen decision D5) — read this before recording provenance

`__version__` is a **human label**. It is not, and cannot be made into, an identity for the
running code. `importlib.metadata` resolves the *distribution* installed in the environment, not
the module that was actually imported, so a modified vendored copy of `qfbench2_common` on
`PYTHONPATH` reports whatever version an unrelated `site-packages` distribution happens to carry.
That is not hypothetical: it was executed, and a forked copy reported `2.1.0`. Three further
disagreements were live on the development machine at the same time — an editable install frozen
at `2.1.0` against a `pyproject.toml` saying `2.3.0`, a HEAD 465 insertions past its own tag still
reporting that tag's version, and a historical `v2.1.0` tag shipping version `2.0.0`.

So: **never populate a C2 or C8 provenance field from `__version__`.** Use `build_identity()`,
which reports a `source_tree_digest` stamped into the package at build time, and
`verify_build_identity()`, which recomputes that digest from the bytes on disk. A version string
is unfalsifiable by construction; a digest over the shipped tree is exactly what a vendored fork
cannot forge, which is why C8 records a digest and not a version.

### `source_tree_digest` vs the C8 `distribution_digest` — two names now, deliberately

These are two different digests and they were briefly both called `distribution_digest`, in two
contracts, meaning two things. They are not interchangeable and neither can be computed from the
other:

| Name | Covers | Computed by |
|---|---|---|
| `source_tree_digest` (here) | the shipped **package tree** — the bytes actually imported | code inside the wheel, about itself |
| `distribution_digest` (C8) | the built **wheel file**'s sha256 | the release job, from outside the wheel |

No code inside a wheel can compute its own wheel's sha256 — the value would have to be a member of
the bytes it hashes. That is why the running code attests to its source tree and the release job
records the artifact digest, and why one name for both was a bug waiting for the first auditor who
compared them and found they disagreed.
