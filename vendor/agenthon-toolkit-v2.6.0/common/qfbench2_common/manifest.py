"""Per-file data manifest: EXACT bidirectional verification + public-safety enforcement.

## Executive summary (read this first)

`verify_manifest` used to iterate the manifest and nothing else. A probe tree was built carrying
five separate defects — an absolute `path` that replaced the unit directory outright, a `../`
traversal, a duplicate entry, a symlink whose *target* got hashed, and an unmanifested file planted
on disk — and the old implementation returned **zero errors**. Every one of those is now an error,
and the reason the set is closed rather than "the five we thought of" is that verification runs in
both directions:

* **manifest -> disk.** Every entry's path is validated as a relative, NFC-normalized, traversal-free
  path *before* it is joined to anything, then resolved one component at a time against a directory
  descriptor with `O_NOFOLLOW`. A symlink is refused, not followed; a hard link (`st_nlink > 1`) is
  refused, because it is the same inode as whatever it was linked from and no symlink exists to
  detect; a FIFO, socket or device is refused as an unsupported node type; a mode-000 file is an
  explicit error and never "absent".
* **disk -> manifest.** The covered subtrees are walked with the same no-follow walk, and any
  regular file that is not in the manifest is an error. This is the direction that did not exist,
  and it is the one that catches a planted file.

Plus, across the whole entry set: no duplicate path, no case-insensitive collision, and no NFC/NFD
collision. The last two matter because the development hosts are macOS (APFS folds both) and the
workers are Linux (which does not) — a tree that verifies on one and means something different on
the other is exactly the shape this check exists to refuse.

### `coverage`: which subtrees the manifest claims to be exact over

A unit directory legitimately holds files that are not data — `card.toml`, `task.toml`,
`instruction.md`, `manifest.json` itself. Declaring the manifest exact over the whole unit would
make every real unit fail, so the manifest says what it covers:

```json
{"manifest_version": "2.0", "coverage": ["environment/data"], "files": [...]}
```

Each entry is a relative directory (or `"."` for the whole unit), covered **recursively**. When
`coverage` is absent it is *derived*, and the derivation is stated here rather than left implicit:

* the **immediate parent directory** of every entry that has one, covered recursively — so a
  manifest listing `environment/data/input.txt` is exact over all of `environment/data/`;
* plus the unit root, **non-recursively, always**.

The parent, not the first component, and the difference is load-bearing: a real Track 1 unit keeps
`environment/Dockerfile` (build input, not released data) beside `environment/data/` (released
data, manifested). Deriving `environment/` would refuse every such unit, which would make the check
something people turn off.

"Always" for the unit root is a change from "if any entry is a root-level file", and it is a fix
rather than a tightening. Under the old rule whether the root was policed at all was decided by an
accident of the manifest's contents: a unit whose manifest listed only `environment/data/input.txt`
had NO root coverage, so an `answers.json` planted beside `card.toml` produced zero errors, while
the identical file one level down inside `environment/data/` was refused. Measured over the 274
staged units of all four tracks, making it unconditional produces exactly one new error, and that
error is true — `t4-EXAMPLE-eps-beat` does not manifest its `task.json`, which its ten sibling
units all manifest.

The residual gap is real and is named on purpose: a manifest with no entry under `docs/` does not
police `docs/`, and neither does it police `environment/` in the example above. Declaring
`coverage` is how a unit closes it, and a unit that wants no gap declares `["."]`. `manifest.json`
is never an extra — a checksum manifest cannot contain its own checksum — and neither are the three
non-data unit-root files named above, which is what makes `["."]` a declaration a real unit can
actually adopt.

# The oracle SOLUTION and authoring scratch must never appear in a public repo.
# Note: practice tasks (split = public-dev) MAY ship their tests and reference VALUES (e.g.
# checks/reference_data/expected.json) so participants can self-grade — that is the point of a
# practice pool. What we hide in public is:
#   (a) the reference IMPLEMENTATION / oracle (solution/, reference/solve.sh, solution.py, *oracle*)
#       and explicit answer keys (answer_key*) — NEVER legitimate in a public repo, any split;
#   (b) authoring scratch (dev/);
#   (c) for any NON public-dev unit (held-out / validation / mis-tagged): also the answer-bearing
#       dirs and files (reference/, references/, reference_data/, adversarial_variants/, expected*,
#       outcome*.json, checkpoints.json).
# Held-out (private-test) answer keys live only in the private repo.
#
# Two tiers so the check matches the practice-pool design AND the firewall promise in the docs.
#
# Both vocabularies are SPELLING-COMPLETE on purpose. A guard that knows `solution/` but not
# `solutions/`, or `reference/` but not `references/`, is not a weaker guard — it is a guard with a
# published bypass, and the bypass is a plural `s`. Measured on this tree 2026-08-29: a planted
# `solutions/ref.py` and a planted `solve.py` both returned zero errors, and so did a
# `references/trace.parquet` on a `validation` unit, while their singular spellings were refused.
#
# `reference_data` joins them for the same reason, and it is the spelling that got away. Track 3's
# batched reference material was moved out of `references/` into `checks/reference_data/` so it
# would comply with rule (4) rather than trip it — and `checks/reference_data/` was a name this set
# did not know, so it stopped being answer material by being renamed. Measured 2026-08-29 on a
# private copy of `t3-gbatch-homog-4`: with the split flipped to `validation`, reference material
# under `checks/reference_data/` returned ZERO errors, and on a practice unit so did an answer key
# at `checks/reference_data/reference_data/outcome.json` — the blocked layout rebuilt one directory
# inside the exemption, which is the bypass `_self_grading_path` already refuses for `reference/`.
# The practice pool's own `checks/reference_data/` root stays exempt; see `_self_grading_path`,
# which now has to say so out loud because the root's own name is answer vocabulary.

    on an accident of the manifest's contents rather than on any policy: measured on this tree
    2026-08-29, an `answers.json` planted at the root of a unit whose manifest listed only
