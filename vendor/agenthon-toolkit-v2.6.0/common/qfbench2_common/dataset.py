"""Split a unit tree into what a submission may see and what only the grader may see.

`ingest.py` bind-mounts each unit directory wholesale at `/input`, with no filtering of any kind.
So whatever is in the unit directory of the phase's `input_data` is readable by the submission --
including, if nobody separates them, the answers.

This is NOT the same question `manifest.assert_public_safe` answers. That one is repo hygiene:
what may sit in a public repo. It deliberately PERMITS answer material in `public-dev` units,
because practice units ship their answers so participants can self-grade locally. That is correct
and should stay. The mistake is reusing those same directories as an eval dataset without
splitting them, and no check catches that, because from the repo's point of view nothing is wrong.

CodaBench already provides the two slots this needs: `input_data` is mounted into the submission,
`reference_data` is read by the scoring program. This module builds the two trees that go in them.

Track 3's builder (`build_final_bundle.py`) has done this for the sealed set since before this
module existed; the declarations and the gate are lifted here so T1, T2 and T4 inherit them
instead of each re-deriving what an answer looks like.

## Two things changed on 2026-08-21, and both were measured defects

**1. The copy dereferenced links.** `shutil.copytree` without `symlinks=True` resolves a link and
copies the *target's bytes* as an ordinary file. A single cross-unit link
`unit_a/environment/aux.csv -> unit_b/reference/realized.parquet` therefore put `unit_b`'s answer
into `unit_a`'s mounted tree as a plain CSV, `split_unit` returned success, and no `AnswerLeak` was
raised. The content check could not catch it either, because `answer_blobs` is computed from *this*
unit only. Both copies are now no-follow walks over regular files (`qfbench2_common.sanitize`), and
a link or special node anywhere in the source is `UnsafeSourceTree` — an organizer fault, refused
before either tree is built. `symlinks=True` would have preserved the link instead of resolving it,
which is better but still wrong: a relative link inside a mounted tree is resolved by the *reader*,
and the reader is the submission.

**2. `ANSWER_DIRS` was two lists wearing one name (frozen ruling R-7).** "Strip this from the
mounted tree" and "fingerprint this as an answer" are different questions, and Track 4's
`factor_replication_exec` family is where the conflation bites: `tests/` must be stripped (it holds
`tests/data/thresholds.json` — the pass threshold, the composite weights, `ref_icir`/`ref_spread`
to full precision, and the reward keyword list, a rubric and an answer key at once), but it must
NOT be fingerprinted, because `tests/data/mkt_rf.csv` is byte-identical to the legitimate input
`environment/data/mkt_rf_monthly.csv` and the content check would refuse all six units. Under the
old single list, declaring `tests` closed the leak and broke the build; not declaring it kept the
build green over an open leak. `STRIP_DIRS` and `FINGERPRINT_DIRS` separate the two, and the
invariant `FINGERPRINT ⊆ STRIP` is asserted at import: fingerprinting something you leave mounted
would flag the mounted copy against itself.

R-7 says do both and ship neither alone. This module is the Hub half; Track 4 stopping the
duplicate-filename shipping is the other half, and it is not a substitute for this one.

A caveat for whoever generalises this: a declaration derived FROM the current unit trees recognises
today's layouts by construction and earns nothing against them. The old `ANSWER_DIRS["analysis"]`
would have passed "do all 36 units have reference/?" while this family mounted its own oracle. The
test that matters is whether a family with a DIFFERENT layout gets covered.

# Measured from the real units in each private repo, 2026-08-19. `reference/` covers three tracks;
# Track 3 is the outlier -- it stores answers FLAT beside the inputs, and batched units keep
# per-sub copies under `references/` (plural).
#
#   coding       reference/solve.sh                  (a runnable oracle)
#   forecasting  reference/realized.parquet          (the forecast target)
#   simulation   trace.parquet, events.json, message_trace.parquet   (flat),
#                checks/reference_data/ (batched; was references/ until the 2026-08 rename)
#   analysis     reference/outcome.json, adversarial_variants/, solution/, tests/ (exec family)
#
# The reference family is spelled THREE ways across the benchmark and all three are declared on
# every track, because the one thing these tables must survive is a rename. Track 3's batched
# reference material moved from `references/` to `checks/reference_data/` so it would satisfy
# `manifest.assert_public_safe` rather than escape it -- and landed on a name neither of these
# tables knew, which is worse than where it started. Measured 2026-08-29 on a private copy of
# `t3-gbatch-homog-4`: a planted `book_snapshot.parquet` (a basename `STRIP_FILES` does not list)
# was stripped under `references/` and SURVIVED INTO THE MOUNTED TREE under
# `checks/reference_data/`, and a byte-identical copy of it at `scenarios/` drew no `AnswerLeak`.
# Today's 90 shipped Track-3 reference files were stripped only because all 90 happen to be named
# `trace.parquet`, `events.json` or `message_trace.parquet`; the directory itself was invisible.
#
# So `reference`, `references` and `reference_data` are declared TOGETHER on every track, for the
# same reason `manifest._ORACLE_DIRS` lists `solution` and `solutions` together: a vocabulary that
# knows one spelling of a name is not a weaker guard than one that knows all three, it is a guard
# with a published bypass, and the bypass is a rename nobody has to justify. `manifest._ANSWER_DIRS`
# already refuses all three names in a public unit on EVERY track, so a track whose strip table
# recognises fewer of them is not being permissive on purpose -- it is out of step with the gate
# that shares its vocabulary. Adding the missing spellings changes nothing on any unit that exists:
# measured across all 274 staged public units, no unit carries a `reference/`, `references/` or
# root-level `reference_data/` directory, and Track 1's `checks/reference_data/` already sat inside
