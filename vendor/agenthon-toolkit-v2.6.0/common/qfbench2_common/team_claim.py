"""Team claim: the participant side of "prove your team inside the submission zip".

## Executive summary (read this first)

There is no registration page. A team proves who it is by putting its website **team number**
and a **proof computed under its Team Key** into `team-claim.json` beside `submission.json`,
from the CodaBench account it will use for every upload; the organizer's intake reads that file
on the account's first upload and links the account.

**The Team Key itself never enters the zip.** An uploaded submission zip is downloadable by
anyone -- measured on the platform, 2026-09-10: an unauthenticated request lists the submission
and returns a presigned link to the archive as soon as the run is placed on a leaderboard, which
the leaderboard rule does automatically for every team. So the claim carries an HMAC bound to
*this* upload's descriptor. What that provably buys: a zip reader gets neither the Team Key nor
the fingerprint the organizer stores, and the tag verifies for this one descriptor and no other,
so it cannot be lifted into a different submission. What it does not buy: the *whole* archive,
re-uploaded unchanged, still carries a claim that verifies, and that links the uploading account
only for as long as the team is not yet linked -- after which a second account claiming it is
refused. Nor does any of it remove guessing; the searchable value there is the published
`team_id`, not the claim (see the organizer's TEAM-CLAIM-PROOF-DECISION.md).

The C5 `team_id` is not assigned by anyone: it is **derived** from the number and the key,

    team_id = "team-" + sha256(b"agenthon2026-team-alias:" + str(team_number).encode()
                               + b":" + team_key.encode()).hexdigest()[:32]

The organizer's `registered_team_admission.derive_team_alias` is the same function; the two
repositories share a test vector so they cannot drift apart unnoticed. The key is hashed exactly
as issued: no trimming, no case folding, no Unicode normalization. A different key is a different
team id.

What this module guarantees about the key: it enters through a hidden prompt or a file the
participant owns, it is **never written anywhere at all**, and no function here puts it in a
message, an exception, a log line, a return value or a file. It is used only to derive the
`team_id` and the claim proof. `qfbench2 submission pack|alias` in `cli.py` is the entry point.
