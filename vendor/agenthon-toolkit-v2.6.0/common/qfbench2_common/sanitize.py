"""C3 materializer primitives: the directory-FD-relative, no-follow walk and copy.

## Executive summary (read this first)

`qfbench2_common.contracts.artifact_tree` owns the C3 **policy** — which node types are refused,
which bounds apply, what a rejection is called. This module owns the **syscalls**: the walk that
produces the observations that policy is applied to, and the copy that turns an accepted listing
into a fresh, scorer-owned tree of ordinary bytes. Splitting them that way is deliberate; five
workstreams must not each invent their own answer to "what counts as a malicious tree", and a
policy module that also does I/O cannot be unit-tested against a synthetic listing.

Three rules run through every function here, and each of them is a measured defect rather than a
precaution:

1. **`Path.is_file()` returns `True` for a symlink to a file.** It is not a defence, it has never
   been a defence, and the audit's `rel-symlink-to-ref` case exists precisely because a guard
   written with it passes an attack. Every stat in this module is `os.lstat`; every open carries
   `O_NOFOLLOW`; every directory is opened with `O_NOFOLLOW | O_DIRECTORY` and every child is
   named *relative to that descriptor* via `dir_fd=`. A symlink is therefore never traversed,
   never opened, and never resolved — it is classified and refused.
2. **A hard link leaves no symlink to detect.** `st_nlink > 1` on a regular file is the only
   signal that the participant's `predictions.json` and the grader's `targets.json` are the same
   inode, so it is refused by link count.
3. **Hashes are over the copied bytes.** `sha256` is computed by the writer, from the buffer that
   was actually written into the destination, never by re-opening a participant path. A digest
   taken by re-reading the source is a digest of whatever the source is at read time.

### What "fresh destination, then atomic promote" buys

`materialize_tree` refuses to write into an existing destination and `promote` moves a completed
staging directory into place with a single `os.rename`. A consumer therefore never observes a
half-built tree, and a build that fails partway leaves the previous state untouched — which is the
property global rule 8 asks for ("built into a fresh destination, checked bidirectionally, and
atomically promoted").

### Bounds, and the one the corpus forces you to be explicit about

`TreeLimits` (from `contracts`) bounds file count, depth, per-file bytes, total bytes and the
sparse-allocation ratio. The shared corpus ships an 8 GiB-apparent / few-blocks-allocated file
specifically because "apparent size" and "allocated size" are both defensible and a limit that
does not say which one it means is not a limit. This module measures **apparent size**
(`st_size`) for the byte bounds and records the ratio separately, so the choice is stated rather
than incidental.

### Deliberate non-goals

* **Content parsing.** A truncated JSON file and a file full of `NaN` are perfectly ordinary
  regular files; C3 accepts them and the track parser reports `malformed_output`. Refusing them
  here would put schema knowledge in the sanitizer and make every track's failure code
  unattributable.
* **Row counting.** The C3 manifest carries parquet `num_rows` so a row-count bound can run before
  a parser does, but reading a footer means running a parquet reader over participant bytes.
  `row_counter` is therefore an injected callback with a default of "record `null`"; a caller that
  wants row counts opts in and owns the reader.

> **Binding test-environment caveat.** The case-collision and Unicode-collision defences cannot be
> exercised on macOS — APFS folds both spellings, so the malicious tree cannot even be built. They
> must be exercised on the Linux workers. A green local run is not evidence for those two.
