"""Leakage / cutoff / embargo / contamination controls.

## Executive summary (read this first)

Closed-resource evaluation: data is sealed in both network modes — `none` is fully offline,
`restricted` allows model-API calls only, through the audited egress proxy.

**Frozen ruling R-8 (contract set 1.0.0): canary handling is verdict-only across every boundary.**
This module exposes exactly

    {"canary_verdict": "clean" | "hit", "hit_count": int,
     "scanned_file_count": int, "scanned_bytes": int}

and nothing else. The previous `scan_canary(text, registry) -> list[str]` returned the *matched
GUIDs*, i.e. the secret itself, from shared code that every track and the scoring container import.
That API is **withdrawn**, not deprecated: a token-returning function in shared code guarantees the
token reaches a log eventually — somebody prints the return value, or wraps it in an exception
message, or puts it in a `detail` dict that `failure_labels` serializes into a persistent CodaBench
artifact. The raw matched form now lives only inside the security-owned scanner, which is
not this package.

Three properties this module maintains, and which its tests assert directly:

1. **No return value, exception message, log line or `repr` contains a matched token, a registry
   entry, or a scanned path.** Counts and a two-valued verdict are the entire output vocabulary.
2. **Fail closed.** A tree the scanner cannot fully read is never reported `clean`. Anything that
   would leave bytes unexamined — a non-regular node, an unreadable file, a bound exceeded — raises
   `LeakageScanIncomplete` instead of returning a verdict.
3. **All bounded regular bytes are scanned**, at any nesting depth, whatever the filename. There is
   no extension allowlist: the interesting file is the one called `notes`, `.hidden`, or
   `output.bin`. Matching is over raw bytes, so a canary in a parquet footer or a pickled blob is
   found exactly as one in JSON is.

`LeakageScanIncomplete` is an `OrganizerFault` on purpose. The scanner is meant to run over the C3
`sanitized/` root, where the sanitizer has already refused every non-regular node and enforced the
size bounds; if the scanner meets one anyway, the wiring is wrong, not the participant. Per the
frozen C1 `organizer_failure` policy that aborts the evaluation rather than producing a
participant score.
