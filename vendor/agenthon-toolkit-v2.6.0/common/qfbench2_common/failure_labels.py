"""Cross-track failure-mode taxonomy, the public projection, and the reporter.

Every gate failure and every scored-but-wrong outcome emits a label. Aggregated across
tracks these labels form the unified failure-mode map that is the competition's headline
scientific artifact. Labels are stable identifiers so the post-competition paper can be
regenerated from the released JSONL.

## What changed on 2026-08-21, and why (frozen C4)

`report()` used to serialize an **arbitrary** `detail` dict and a raw `unit_id` verbatim into
JSONL, with no allowlist, no size bound and no `allow_nan=False`; `score.py` pointed that file at
the CodaBench *output* directory. A synthetic sentinel planted in a track scorer's diagnostics was
measured surviving into `failure_map.jsonl` through both channels.

Three things close it, and they are all in this module:

1. **`public_detail(detail)`** — the one shared redactor. It filters an arbitrary producer dict down
   to the frozen C4 public projection: *enum code plus integer counts only*, no free-form strings.
   Track 2 asked for exactly this function so the private final scorer and every future entrypoint
   call the same code instead of each keeping a copy of an allowlist. The allowlist itself lives in
   `qfbench2_common.contracts.result.public_detail_keys()`; this is the filtering front end.
2. **`report(..., sink="public")` is the default and redacts.** Raw diagnostics require an explicit
   `sink="operator"` and a caller that has chosen an operator-only path. Absent that choice nothing
   sensitive is written anywhere, which is the fail-closed direction.
3. **`public_failure_code(labels)`** — the label -> frozen-C4-code mapping, so a track's rich
   internal label becomes one of twelve bounded public codes rather than a string somebody invents
   at a call site.

`unit_id` was renamed to `unit_handle` in `report()`. The rename is the point: C1 commits opaque
handles and a sealed unit id must never reach a persistent leaderboard artifact. Positional callers
are unaffected; a caller passing `unit_id=` by keyword must update.

#: invalid interval and a nonfinite value in participant data were all reported as "your output
#: parsed but did not match the published output schema" — false for all but the first reading of
#: it, and it sends the participant hunting for a schema defect that is not there.
#:
#: `domain_gate_failed` says the true thing: the output was well-formed and then failed a rule the
#: unit published separately from its schema. Two agents asked for it independently; adding it was
#: a registry version bump (see `contracts/MIGRATIONS.md`), which is the supported way to grow a
