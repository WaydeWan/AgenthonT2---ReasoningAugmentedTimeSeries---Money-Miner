# qfbench2-common — shared evaluation harness (Agenthon 2026 / QFBench 2.0)

Every track repo **pip-installs** shared parsing and scoring utilities from this repository at
a pinned tag. Record the actual program/toolkit pins and runtime configuration when reproducing
an evaluation; installing this package alone does not establish Development/Final equivalence.

```bash
pip install "qfbench2-common @ git+https://github.com/Agenthon-2026/Agenthon2026-public.git@v2.6.0#subdirectory=common"
```

There is no git submodule. Pin the tag: installing from a moving branch means your local result
and the scored result can diverge without either being wrong.

```

**Contracts a track repo must honor:** ship one `card.toml` (v2) + `manifest.json` per unit;
expose `qfbench2_track_<track>.scoring.build_verifier(ctx)` returning a `HierarchicalVerifier`;
keep all ground-truth artifacts out of the public repo (`manifest.assert_public_safe` is wired
into public CI).

A track whose `build_verifier` refuses off-platform — because it needs a pinned judge (Track 4) or
trusted organizer telemetry (Track 3) — must additionally expose a non-rankable preview factory
under one of the two names in `smoke.PREVIEW_FACTORIES`, `build_developer_verifier` or
`build_smoke_verifier`. `qfbench2-smoke` prefers those and falls back to `build_verifier` for a
track that has neither. `--profile production` reaches `build_verifier` and no other name.

Quickstart — run from the root of a **track kit**, not from this repository:
```bash
pip install -e "./common[data,dev]"      # quote the extras: zsh globs the brackets
pip install -e .                         # the track kit itself: provides qfbench2_track_<track>
qfbench2-smoke units/<unit> ./my_output --track <track>
```

> `qfbench2-smoke` imports `qfbench2_track_<track>.scoring` from the track repo. Installed
> alone, this toolkit cannot run it: the command exits non-zero with
> `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'qfbench2_track_<track>'`. Install the track kit (or
> set `PYTHONPATH` to the kit root) first.

The unified `qfbench2` CLI exposes `smoke`, `card`, `manifest`, `eval`, `track1` and `track4`. The `track1`
group (`harbor-run` / `score-harbor-job`) drives the Track-1 **Harbor adapter** and needs the
optional `harbor` extra (`harbor>=0.15.0`, whose **Python ≥ 3.12** floor is already met by the
toolkit's **Python ≥ 3.13**). Harbor is shelled out (never imported), so `qfbench2_common` imports
and runs on 3.13 with Harbor absent:
```bash
# operator-only; enables qfbench2 track1 ...
pip install "qfbench2-common[harbor] @ git+https://github.com/Agenthon-2026/Agenthon2026-public.git@v2.6.0#subdirectory=common"
```
